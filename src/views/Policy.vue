        <ul>
          <li>
            I am a home-based nail tech in Historic Norfolk.
            The only form of parking available is street parking.
            You may have to parallel park and are responsible for your parking.
          </li>
          <li>
            In case of severe allergies, I do have cats,
            but they are not in the nail room.
            The nail room is enclosed, private,
            and kept clean at all times.
          </li>
          <li>
            To have an idea of where I am located,
            check out
            <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/un2chf8jUa7eMDQ89" target="_blank">Cure Coffeehouse</a> on Google Maps.
          </li>
          <li>
            You will need to pay a <b>$10 NON-REFUNDABLE DEPOSIT</b> to secure a time-slot.
            I collect deposits through
            CashApp: <a href="https://cash.app/$hotdamnnails">$hotdamnnails</a> or
            Venmo: <a href="https://venmo.com/hotdamnnails">@hotdamnnails</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            The non-refundable deposit will go towards your set.
            Please try and book an appointment you are sure you can attend.
          </li>
          <li>
            Due to Covid-19 currently guests are not allowed to
            accompany you to your appointment &amp; a mask must
            be worn throughout the appointment.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you have previous nails, not done by me,
            please have them soaked off and come in with bare nails.
          </li>
          <li>
             Time slots are in 3hr intervals. When you book with me, you are booking a 3 hr session
             with me. 1-color fresh sets and fills are already 1.5hrs. A soak off is 30-45mins.
             The more design add ons, the more time is needed. So please book accordingly.
          </li>
          <li>
            Rushed appointments or repeatedly arriving late
            will result in no future bookings with me.
            (On average hand designed sets take about 2 hours)

            Any <b>FRESH SET</b> nails that <b>POP OFF</b>
            within 3 days of your appointment can be repaired for free.
            <span class="indent">
              After 3 days it will be $3/nail for repairs. For all repairs DM me on <a href="https://instagram.com/hotdamnnails">Instagram</a>.

            <b>BOOK A FRESH SET<sup>*</sup> (recommendations)</b>:
            <span class="indent">
              If you have had 3 consecutive fill ins.
            </span>
            <span class="indent">
              If you want a different shape or extreme length change.
            </span>
            <span class="indent">
              The bond between the nail and acrylic will
              loosen when nail is filed down and reshaped multiple times.
              You can save money on nail repairs by getting a
              fresh set if the nails seem to be getting weak.
            </span>
            <span class="indent">
              If you want a different base color acrylic (powder) such as <b>CLEAR</b>.
              You can also pay for a repair to make specific nails clear.

            <span class="indent">
              If you have 3 or more broken nails after a couple weeks

            <span class="indent">
              If your real nail underneath is long and separating from the acrylic.
              (I do not file off grown out nails under acrylic
              as this can cause over filing and breakage.)
