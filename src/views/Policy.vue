            In case of severe allergies, I do have cats, but they are not in the nail room.
            The nail room is enclosed, private, and kept clean at all times.
          </li>

          <li class="title">DEPOSIT/PAYMENT INFO:</li>
          <li>
            You will need to pay a $10 NON-REFUNDABLE DEPOSIT to secure a time-slot.
            I collect deposits through
            CashApp: <a href="https://cash.app/$hotdamnnails">$hotdamnnails</a> or
            Venmo: <a href="https://venmo.com/hotdamnnails">@hotdamnnails</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            The non-refundable deposit will go towards your set.
            You are allowed to reschedule up until 48 hours
            before your appointment. All reschedules and
            cancelations are done through Direct Message on
            Instagram <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hotdamnnails/" target="_blank">@hotdamnnails</a>
            or Text <a href="tel:757-231-7978">757-231-7978</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            One (1) reschedule is allowed per appointment
            made and must be rebooked within the same month.
            Any further need to reschedule will result in the forfeit of your deposit.
            Please try and book an appointment you are sure you can attend.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li class="title">UPON ARRIVAL:</li>
          <li>
            If you have previous nails, not done by me,
            I suggest please have them soaked off and come in with bare nails.
            If you come in with nails (not my work) I will soak it off
            for you for an add on 20$ & if there is enough time for it.
          </li>
          <li>
            Due to Covid-19 currently guests are not allowed to accompany you
            to your appointment & a MASK must be worn throughout the appointment.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li class="title">TIME INFO/LATE ARRIVAL:</li>
          <li>
            15 minutes late without notice, your appointment will automatically be canceled.
            Deposits are not refundable and cannot be used to reschedule in this situation.
          </li>
          <li>Repetitively arriving late (15mins or later) will result in no future booking.</li>
          <li>No call no show will result in no future booking.</li>
          <li>
            Time slots are in 3hr intervals. Your set and add-on services may
            take 1.5hrs to 3hrs depending on the design.
            Please make sure to have your time planned out.
          </li>
          <li>
            Rushed appointments or repeatedly arriving late (15 mins or later)
            will result in no future bookings with me.
            (On average, hand-designed sets take about 2 hours)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li class="title">MY RIGHT TO CANCEL</li>
          <li>
            Due to unexpected emergencies such as illness and family matters and etc.,
            cancelation of appointments may happen. If this does happen,
            you will be given an option to refund the deposit or reschedule with a discount.
          </li>
          <li>Rudeness / Aggressive behavior will NOT be tolerated.</li>
          <li>
            Please let me know your expectations during your design consultation
            or at the time of your appointment so that your needs can be met.
            These changes will only be upheld during the appointment,
            not after you leave your appointment.
          </li>
